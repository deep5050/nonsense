## Install
simply run `npm install nonsense-license` and add `const license = require('nonsense-license);` To Your Workfile. :)

## Warning
1. Don't Forget To Replace The Place Holders In many Licenses.

2. Concat Each Entry In the License Text Array With `\n`. Otherwise It Will Break The Original Format.
